## Testing Methodology

## Different Object Sizes

- tiny (62 bytes as JSON)
- small (~1kb)
- medium (~10kb)
- large (~100kb)

## Metrics

## Content-Length

graph: *pre-gzip* and *post-gzip*

## Library overhead

graph: *file size*

## End-to-End (browser)

- Benchmark.js
- in browser graphs

## Browser Runtimes

- benchmark js


## Node Runtimes

- Benchmark.js

Its important to note that Node optimizes for JSON.

Other platforms might see results that favor JSON much less.
