## Basics

## But, why?

## Why? (contd.)

- Save on bandwidth costs
- Possibly save on cpu runtime

<div class="notes">
Whether you are sending large or small data, the percentage of bytes saved is directly proportional to your end of month bandwidth cost.
</div>

## Does Gzip solve all these problems?

Not quite.

<div class="notes">
Gzip levels the playing field. However:
  - Browsers do not gzip data sent to the server
  - Some formats could still save data even after gzip
</div>
